### hello there 🌼

I'm a backend software developer from the UK. I currently work mostly with [Java](https://java.com/), but
I'm familiar with [Scala](https://scala-lang.org), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org) and C too. Most of my repositories have been archived after quite a while of minimal maintenance.
